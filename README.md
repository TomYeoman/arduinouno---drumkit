# arduinouno---drumkit
Desktop drumkit robot

Recently I was given a cool secret santa gift, a desktop drum kit equipped with some kicks and snares.

I've been meaning to have a play around with some p5.js libraries[1], one of which being p5bots [2] arduino library. It provides us the ability to easily control the arduino uno (or other microcontroller running firmata), using javascript. Running an express node server we can control our device directly through the browser ( using socket.io for real time awesomeness ).
